All in one It’s hard to write something on this last day. A lot of mixed feelings, happy to be done but already sad that the adventure is over. Wishing for a new one, but still hating the mosquitoes :)
We got up at 8 am and left around 9 am.</description>

Reindeer in the evening Shortly before we fell asleep the night before, we heard some strange noises from outside the tent. After a while we decided to look whats going on. In the far we saw a really big heard of reindeers and some sami people that were moving them with the help of dogs.</description>

Morning We slept pretty good, it was a bit a change of too hot -&amp;gt; getting out of the sleepingbag, then too cold -&amp;gt; getting in again… and so on :)
But in the morning the mosquitoes already waited for us. So we packed together as fast as possible and went to the emergency shelter to have breakfast.</description>

Morning We slept incredibly well in our room! No mosquitoes and a nice temperature, I think I slept for around 10 hours.
Then we had a small breakfast in our room and off we went. First thing on the todo list was to take the boat to cross the lake. But this is really fast and takes about 10 minutes.</description>

Morning I woke up around 6 am as it was too hot in the tent. After removing the rainfly partially it got a bit better. But on the way back into the tent, around 10 mosquitoes followed me… so it was hunting time again. Unbelievable that they are now on the fjäll as well, we really hope it gets better in the next 1-2 days.</description>

Back on the trail After not the best night thanks to the mosquitoes I got up at 7 am and decided to get breakfast. Nicole slept for another hour :) Even though we hadn’t booked breakfast, I was able to get one (but without eggs) and it was a great start into the day.</description>

Good morning We slept good and got up around 7 am, it was warm more or less the whole night. But in the morning the mosquitoes were still attached to our tent, so putting it down was bit of a challenge.

Windy night Thankfully we and the tent survived the windy night :) Early morning the wind stopped completely. For part of the night I listed to music again to kill the noises from the wind, that works quite good.
In the morning we got a beautiful view out of the tent.</description>

Waking up from the wind I had a bit of a hard time to fall asleep because of the wind. Because it hit the tent quite hard, there was a lot of noise inside of it… everyday another challenge ;-)
At around 1 am i woke up again and couldn’t fell asleep because of the wind.</description>

Good Morning Yesterday shortly before I fell asleep, it started to rain. Not sure how long it continued, but in the morning it was mostly dry. ‌And the mosquitoes were gone! At least for the moment ;-)
  View from the tent spot
  It was quite cloudy, but the sun sometimes managed to push trough and spent some heat.</description>

Cold night The night was cold, the close river probably didn‘t helped with that… I had a really hard time to get out of the sleepingbag but as soon as the sunshine hit me, it was ok 😀
As we reached the plateau yesterday before we set camp, the trail was mostly flat.</description>

Waking up and Breakfast Even if we love our tent and camping in the wild, a real bed is amazing after some days outside. The same goes for a shower and a breakfast. We had all of it in Ammarnäs, but then it was time to hit the trail again.
During the night it rained lightly, but when we started around 10, it was still cloudy but dry.</description>

The first kms followed along the lake, through the forest.

Before the start After we arrived by plane we repacked our stuff directly in front of the mini airport building. Then we went off to get food for the next ~4 days which it will take to reach Ammarnäs. The local ICA had a nice selection of food.
Then we went for a final meal before the start at the „Auroras kök“ and we both choose the Beyond Burger (Vegetarian).</description>

Start: Rheinfelden
End: Hemavan
Train, Plane, Hotel and Plane again Getting to the start of the Kungsleden is quite a journey, at least when you live in switzerland or Rheinfelden to be more specific. There are various options, but we decided to go by plane in the end. As there are no direct (or even combined) flights available, we had to split the journey. So the first flight was Zurich -&amp;gt; Stockholm and as there was no flight which allowed us to capture the next flight to Hemavan on the same day, we went for a Hotel in Stockholm.</description>

      <description>Equipment for the Kungsleden For this year i wanted to put everything into a lighterpack and i really did it 🥳 This is mostly for myself and should help me in the future to optimize the weight.
Lighterpack Base weight could definitely be better and we are considering a ZPacks triplex for the future. But this is a topic for another day.
How does all this stuff look like? I captured two pictures of my equipment, one shows most of the stuff just loose.</description>

      <description>After we really enjoyed our nearly 3 week (20 days) hike on the via Alpina in 2020, we decided to go for another thruhike in 2021. There where multiple options in Switzerland which we considered but in the end we decided for Sweden and the Kungsleden.
Now 4 days before we leave for Stockholm, as first stop in our Journey, the final preparation is going on :)
