      <description>Overview Hiking duration: 9:53
KM: 35.36
Elevation gain in Meters: 969
Start: Fj√§ll near Tj√§urak√•tan
End: Near L√°stak on the trail
Windy night Thankfully we and the tent survived the windy night :) Early morning the wind stopped completely. For part of the night I listed to music again to kill the noises from the wind, that works quite good.
In the morning we got a beautiful view out of the tent.</description>

Boatride There was a bit wind before we went to bed, but not an issue compared to the night before. We both slept pretty good, the swim/shower in the lake helped with that i guess :)

Waking up from the wind I had a bit of a hard time to fall asleep because of the wind. Because it hit the tent quite hard, there was a lot of noise inside of it‚Ä¶ everyday another challenge ;-)
At around 1 am i woke up again and couldn‚Äôt fell asleep because of the wind.</description>

Good Morning Yesterday shortly before I fell asleep, it started to rain. Not sure how long it continued, but in the morning it was mostly dry. ‚ÄåAnd the mosquitoes were gone! At least for the moment ;-)
  View from the tent spot
  It was quite cloudy, but the sun sometimes managed to push trough and spent some heat.</description>

End: Near Sv√°jpavallie
Cold night The night was cold, the close river probably didn‚Äòt helped with that‚Ä¶ I had a really hard time to get out of the sleepingbag but as soon as the sunshine hit me, it was ok üòÄ
As we reached the plateau yesterday before we set camp, the trail was mostly flat.</description>

Elevation gain in Meters: 1160
Start: Ammarn√§s
End: Bridges after R√§vfallstugan
Waking up and Breakfast Even if we love our tent and camping in the wild, a real bed is amazing after some days outside. The same goes for a shower and a breakfast. We had all of it in Ammarn√§s, but then it was time to hit the trail again.
During the night it rained lightly, but when we started around 10, it was still cloudy but dry.</description>

The first kms followed along the lake, through the forest.

End: Shortly after Viterskalsstugan
Before the start After we arrived by plane we repacked our stuff directly in front of the mini airport building. Then we went off to get food for the next ~4 days which it will take to reach Ammarn√§s. The local ICA had a nice selection of food.
Then we went for a final meal before the start at the ‚ÄûAuroras k√∂k‚Äú and we both choose the Beyond Burger (Vegetarian).</description>

      <description>Overview KM: 0 by foot
Start: Rheinfelden
End: Hemavan
Train, Plane, Hotel and Plane again Getting to the start of the Kungsleden is quite a journey, at least when you live in switzerland or Rheinfelden to be more specific. There are various options, but we decided to go by plane in the end. As there are no direct (or even combined) flights available, we had to split the journey. So the first flight was Zurich -&amp;gt; Stockholm and as there was no flight which allowed us to capture the next flight to Hemavan on the same day, we went for a Hotel in Stockholm.</description>

      <description>Equipment for the Kungsleden For this year i wanted to put everything into a lighterpack and i really did it ü•≥ This is mostly for myself and should help me in the future to optimize the weight.
Lighterpack Base weight could definitely be better and we are considering a ZPacks triplex for the future. But this is a topic for another day.
How does all this stuff look like? I captured two pictures of my equipment, one shows most of the stuff just loose.</description>

      <description>After we really enjoyed our nearly 3 week (20 days) hike on the via Alpina in 2020, we decided to go for another thruhike in 2021. There where multiple options in Switzerland which we considered but in the end we decided for Sweden and the Kungsleden.
Now 4 days before we leave for Stockholm, as first stop in our Journey, the final preparation is going on :)
More to follow soon&amp;hellip;</description>
