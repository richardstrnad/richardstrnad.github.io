<h2 id="windy-night">Windy night</h2>
<p>Thankfully we and the tent survived the windy night :) Early morning the wind stopped completely. For part of the night I listed to music again to kill the noises from the wind, that works quite good.</p>
<p>In the morning we got a beautiful view out of the tent.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>We got up at around 7 am and it took us around an hour (as always) to get ready. So we left around 8 am.</p>
<h2 id="into-the-forest">Into the forest</h2>
<p>There was a small stretch of fjäll left and then the trail went down into the forest. At the beginning the forest was still pretty open and the wind still blowing quite strong.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1085.jpeg"
         alt="Beginning of the forest"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Beginning of the forest</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With time the forest grew more densely, but mosquitoes were thankfully still sleeping.
On a small path Nicole nearly stepped on a snake, which then flew quickly into the high grass. Unfortunately we weren’t able to take a picture of it.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1093.jpeg"
         alt="Path through the forest"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Path through the forest</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="over-the-river">Over the river</h2>
<p>We then crossed the river Piteälven over two bigger bridges.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1096.jpeg"
         alt="One of the bridges over Piteälven"/> <figcaption>
            <p>One of the bridges over Piteälven</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After that we first had some wood autobahn, by far the longest stretch until now.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1097.jpeg"
         alt="Wood Autobahn"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Wood Autobahn</p>

<p>Then there was a really beautiful stretch along the river. This was a nice change in scenery compared to the usual fjäll/forest.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1098.jpeg"
         alt="Hiking next to Piteälven"/> <figcaption>

<h2 id="kvikkjokk-ahead">Kvikkjokk ahead</h2>
<p>Then there was a sign which showed that Kvikkjokk was about 30km away. At that point we covered around 8km so far. So we were good in time and hoped that we will reach the boating station late in the evening. Then it would only be the crossing by motorboat in the morning. After that we have more or less a full rest &amp; town day in Kvikkjokk. Finally a bed and real food ;)</p>

<p>Some really amazing forest sections followed, they felt a bit like California.</p>
<figure>

         alt="Forest section"/> <figcaption>

<p>Then there was a first glimpse of the fjäll which we have to cross today. Hopefully with less wind than yesterday.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1106.jpeg"
         alt="View of todays fjäll"/> <figcaption>
            <p>View of todays fjäll</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We had a short lunch break near a lake before the forest hiking continued. There were less and less trees and the views get better and better. The fjäll which we had to cross today approached quickly.</p>
<p>But be for that we hit another quite overgrown part of the trail.</p>
<figure>

         alt="Overgrown part of the trail"/> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>

<h2 id="up-to-the-fjäll">Up to the fjäll</h2>
<p>Then we reached the lower boundary of the fjäll and the real climb started.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1115.jpeg"
         alt="Closer view of the fjäll"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Closer view of the fjäll</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The last part of the climb was steep and it felt like swiss alps :)</p>

    <img src="/img/IMG_1118.jpeg"
         alt="Steep part of the climb"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Steep part of the climb</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From the top we had an amazing view back to the valley we passed today. Also the fjäll were we slept the night before, was visible far away.</p>

         alt="View back from the fjäll"/> <figcaption>
            <p>View back from the fjäll</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There we also met up again with Mathis, Anton and Fredrik. As they arrived a bit later we just had a short chat and then we went ahead to start the fjäll crossing. We all would meet up later on.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1123.jpeg"
         alt="Fjäll crossing"/> <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>It wasn‘t too windy and the scenery was really nice. After the crossing the decline started, first quite steep, then a bit easier.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1126.jpeg"
         alt="Way down from the fjäll"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Way down from the fjäll</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And then we finally hit the Tsielekjåkkstugan hut and had a longer rest and some dinner there. We also met with the rest of the guys there.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1133.jpeg"
         alt="Delicious food"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Delicious food</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="last-push">Last push</h2>
<p>We knew it was around 12/13 km to the boat station. And we wanted to get the 10:30 boat in the next morning. So to have it easy we decided to push on a bit, until we find a nice camping spot.</p>
<p>So first we had to cross the river right next to the hut.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1134.jpeg"
         alt="Bridge right next to Tsielekjåkkstugan"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Bridge right next to Tsielekjåkkstugan</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After that the forest started again and with it the mosquitoes. Shortly after we met a couple which was hiking into the other direction and had a short chat. They warned us about the mosquitoes ahead and to not push too far, as it only gets worse and worse.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/IMG_1137.jpeg"
         alt="Way up in the forest"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Way up in the forest</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We did another 6.5 km and this leaves us with about 6.5 km in the morning. A easy hike after which we will just relax and enjoy Kvikkjokk.</p>
<p>We found an amazing spot for the night, but the mosquitoes were really crazy. Everything before was nothing compared to this. So we put the tent up as fast as we could, threw everything into the tent and jumped in. Then we had to hunt down all the ones that made it into the tent… but now we lie mosquito free in the tent :)</p>
<figure>

         alt="Tent spot (in mosquito hell)"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Tent spot (in mosquito hell)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But we think the night will be great, not too cold, no wind and a flat spot to sleep.</p>
