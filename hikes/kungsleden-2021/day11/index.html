<p>We slept good and got up around 7 am, it was warm more or less the whole night. But in the morning the mosquitoes were still attached to our tent, so putting it down was bit of a challenge.</p>

<h2 id="way-down">Way down</h2>
<p>We hit the trail shortly before 8 am. After around 400m we saw Anton and Fredrik which were packing up. The last 6 km down to the boat were all through forest, so nothing too special.</p>

<p>Sometimes it opened up a bit and then there were nice views of the mountains.</p>

<p>Then we already reached the boat pier which provided an amazing view of the mountains in the back.</p>

<p>We were a bit early and arrive at around 09:30 am so we had to wait about an hour. This time was used for a revitalizing swim in the ice cold lake.</p>

<p>The boat ride was quick and then we reached the shore in front of Kvikkjokk. There was a 5 minute walk to the STF FjÃ¤llstation where we will stay for the night.</p>
<p>We arrived there around 10:50 but checkin wasnâ€™t until 14:00. So we just chilled a bit in the lobby and at 12:00 we ordered lunch (burgers) and beer. Real food!! I was too excited to take a picture, but it looked and tasted really great ðŸ˜‹</p>
<p>The afternoon was then spent with chilling, washing clothes (in the sink) and having a real shower (after 6 days without). It was just great to have a day off :)</p>
<p>In the evening we had dinner at the STF Restaurant and we both went for the vegetable skewers. This time I even took a picture :)</p>

<p>There were some more beer with the guys and then it was time for a real bed.</p>
<p>First we needed to get rid of all the mosquitoes in the room, we killed around 20 and then hoped for a quiet night.</p>
<p>But at around 1 am I woke up because of the mosquitoes and we did another hunt and killed some more. This repeated itself like 1-2 hours laterâ€¦ Nicole had enough by then and we but up the inner tent and she slept thereâ€¦</p>
<p>We hoped for a real bed after 6 nights camping and we got a lot of mosquito bites :)</p>

<h2 id="nero-">Nero ?!</h2>
<p>The term Nero comes from a near Zero (a Zero day on the trail means no km at all). So it means just some easy km, but no serious hiking.</p>
