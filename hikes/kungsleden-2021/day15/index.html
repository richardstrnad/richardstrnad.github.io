<h2 id="morning">Morning</h2>
<p>We slept incredibly well in our room! No mosquitoes and a nice temperature, I think I slept for around 10 hours.</p>
<p>Then we had a small breakfast in our room and off we went. First thing on the todo list was to take the boat to cross the lake. But this is really fast and takes about 10 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="bus">Bus</h2>
<p>Next thing was to take the bus, as the Kungsleden is not complete and the other option would be to road walking for around 30 km.</p>

<p>We even had to change buses and unfortunately had to wait about an hour for the next bus. So more or less the whole morning was spent traveling back to the trail.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-trail-again">On the trail again</h2>
<p>We (Fredrik, Mathias, Anton, Nicole and I) were the only ones that left at Vakkotavare and started the steep climb. Thankfully the climb wasn’t too long and soon we reached the fjäll again.</p>

<p>Soon after the fjäll we also reached a small lake, so it was lunch &amp; swim time. Then the crossing of the fjäll continued, there was also a real river crossing which led to wet feets (or at least wet Sealskinz socks).</p>

<p>After that it was time to descent and the last rowing of the trail. We were lucky, two boats on our side, so we had to do only one way. There was a couple shortly behind us, which had to do the crossing 3 times…</p>

<h2 id="dinner">Dinner</h2>
<p>As we started late today, we only covered 14 km so far but it was already lunch time. We shopped at the Teusajaurestugorna and I got some Gulasch and Tortilla bread which made an amazing dinner!</p>

<h2 id="last-climb">Last climb</h2>
<p>After dinner we started the climb up to the fjäll. This is the last real climb for the rest of the trail (~90 km). It was short but steep and we all wished for a lake to have a swim and get rid of the sweat. But unfortunately we could only find the mosquitoes again… and we hoped so much that this was over. So we just pitched tent and went to bed.</p>

<h2 id="end-is-near">End is near</h2>
<p>We are really close to the end of the trail. Feelings are mixed, we will miss the hiking and the days outside. We will miss our Swedish friends.</p>
<p><strong>But we definitely won’t miss the mosquitoes!!</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, today we booked our train back from Abisko to Stockholm on the 10th. Also a night in the Abisko Fjällstation from the 9th to the 10th. So it‘s fixed, we have to finish on friday. So 4 more days for the last 90 km.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we have to say goodbye to Fredrik and Anton as they will stay at Singi (or shortly after). Hopefully we manage to find some beer to have a final „Bierli“ with them :)</p>
