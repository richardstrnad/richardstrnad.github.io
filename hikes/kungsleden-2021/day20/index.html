<p>Then we packed everything and checked out shortly before 10 am. We had another 2 hours to spend before our train would leave. Both us had the need for some movement, not used to just sit around anymore :)</p>
<p>We did a short 1.5 km walk to the Torneträsk lake and put our feet’s into the ice cold water.</p>

<p>Then we hanged around with Mathias and it was already time to leave for the train station.</p>

<p>We knew that we had to change trains after around 5 hours, the first stretch is just a regular train. In the second train we then will have our sleeping compartment. With only 3 wagons the first train was rather small but more or less empty. Strange was that we got seats assigned that were nearly the whole wagon apart from each other… maybe some sort of COVID measurement. We just sat next to each other and no one cared.</p>

<p>Interesting was that we sometimes had long stops, one was nearly 30 minutes. Not used to that from switzerland. But the views were impressive, endless nature! Sometimes really small villages, but overall just large forests.</p>
<p>We were then informed that there is an issue with the next train and wagons 10-13 are missing. Thankfully we had a compartment in wagon 14. Mathias was not that lucky and he had the option to just sit in a regular seat or wait 4 hours for the next train.</p>
<p>As we had booked the whole compartment for ourself, we were able to offer him one of the free beds. He accepted thankfully and we got a beer as payment :)</p>

<p>We then had a dinner in the restaurant wagon (salmon for me, veggie gnocchi for Nicole). Was good, especially for a train restaurant.</p>
<p>The bed was definitely more comfortable than expected and with that we say good night on day 20.</p>

<p>We arrived about 1 hour too late in Stockholm but it didn’t matter as we anyway way too earlier (7:40 am instead of 6:40). As nothing was open, we decided to give it a shot and try a super early checkin, which succeeded!</p>
<p>Now our Stockholm holiday starts and this story ends. Thanks to all who read it this far :)</p>
