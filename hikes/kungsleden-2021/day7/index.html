<p>Yesterday shortly before I fell asleep, it started to rain. Not sure how long it continued, but in the morning it was mostly dry. ‚Äå<strong>And the mosquitoes were gone!</strong>
At least for the moment ;-)</p>

<p>It was quite cloudy, but the sun sometimes managed to push trough and spent some heat. We hiked for about 4 km, mostly on open areas and eat breakfast before we hit the forest again.</p>

</figure>

<p>We knew that B√§verholem is about 6km ahead and Adolfsstr√∂m about 14km. Our plan was to eat something in Adolfsstr√∂m and then hike a bit further to a nice camping spot.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes are not too bad so far, let‚Äôs see how it‚Äôs in the forest‚Ä¶
We declined further and the mosquitoes became a bit more but not a real issue, this allowed us to enjoy nature and the trail more!</p>

<p>Multiple bridges were crossed once again.</p>

<p>We reached B√§verholmen, a really small settlement. There was an option to use a water taxi to Adolfsstr√∂m, but we decided to walk the ~8km.</p>
<figure>

         alt="B√§verholmen"/> <figcaption>

<p>The walk was mostly through forest, but allowed for some beautiful views of the lake.</p>

</figure>

<p>We reached Adolfsstr√∂m and hoped for a real meal, but unfortunately there isn‚Äòt a restaurant in Adolfsstr√∂m‚Ä¶ naive swiss peoples assume there are restaurants everywhere üòÇ</p>
<p>So we grabbed some snacks from the small Cafe and relaxed outside. We met Matthias and the other two Swedish guys again. Was fun to have a chat and catch up again after 2 days.</p>

<p>So the town wasn‚Äôt as initially expected, but still great in the end. After around a 1:30h break we decided to continue, our goal was to reach the treeline to get rid of the mosquitoes.</p>
<p>First part of the climb was on a bigger street which allowed to push the pace and we made fast progress.</p>
<figure>

         alt="Larger trail leaving Adolfsstr√∂m"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Larger trail leaving Adolfsstr√∂m</p>

<p>Then the trail narrowed down again and mosquito pressure increased‚Ä¶</p>

</figure>

<p>We reached a lake after around 6 km which was our first planned stop, we looked for a tent spot there but couldn‚Äôt find a ideal one. So we decided to continue on, even tough the treeline was another 8km hike.</p>
<figure>

         alt="Short break at the lake"/> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After around 7 more km we reached a hut, shortly before the treeline. There were 2 germans with which we had a short chat in german ;)</p>
<p>We also met our 3 Swedish friends there, they used the hut to have dinner. Together we decided to push on to the treeline and camp there. In the end we set camp up close to each other.</p>
