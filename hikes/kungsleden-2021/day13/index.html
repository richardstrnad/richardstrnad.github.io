<p>The night was on the warm side but we slept perfectly! Especially after the mosquito infested hostel room…</p>

<p>First target of the day was to reach boat station. Schedule of the motorboat was 9 am and 5 pm but there was also a rowing option. And as the weather was perfect, we decided that we would just row. But first was the way down through the forest.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes were already up and it was a pain again… you can’t take a break, you can’t enjoy it, you just walk to leave them behind you… but it is how it is.</p>
<h2 id="over-the-lake">Over the lake</h2>
<p>After around 1:30h we reached the boating station and Mathias was already waiting in a boat. We were really lucky, 2 boats on our site and another just arrived. So we splitted up into two boats (Anton &amp; Fredrik, Mathias &amp; Nicole &amp; I).</p>

</figure>

<p>It only took us a bit over half an hour for the ~ 3 km row. Mathias did most of it and I tried to help and did a part in the middle.</p>
<p>Then we reached Akstestugan where we had planned to shop but the shop was closed. Thankfully the lady was really nice and let us shop anyhow. So we got more food for the next 2/3 days.</p>
<h2 id="and-up-again">And up again</h2>
<p>Next up was the climb up the fjäll again, it was pretty steep but short, so now long forest stretches.</p>
<figure>

         alt="Up it goes"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Up it goes</p>

<p>Then we reached the point were we had to leave the Kungsleden and started the climb of Skierffe.</p>

<p>It took its time but we were able to leave our backpacks as we had to pass through again on the way down.</p>
<h2 id="skierffe">Skierffe</h2>
<p>Skierffe is one of the detours which is definitely worth it! Especially if there is so great weather as it was today. The view down and into Sarek is unbelievable!</p>

<p>After that we went back to our packs and could then leverage the height and traverse back to the Kungsleden.</p>
<p>On the way back we found a mountain lake and took a swim there. Refreshing as always :)</p>

<p>Then we already reached a nice tent spot and made dinner. Something new was tested, couscous in tortilla bread. Nice change and was delicious!</p>

<p>It was really hot, around 30 degrees Celsius and steep! But the view from Skierffe was unbelievable!</p>
