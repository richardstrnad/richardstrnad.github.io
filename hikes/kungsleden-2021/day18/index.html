<p>Shortly before we fell asleep the night before, we heard some strange noises from outside the tent. After a while we decided to look whats going on. In the far we saw a really big heard of reindeers and some sami people that were moving them with the help of dogs.</p>
<h2 id="night">Night</h2>
<p>During the night there were some short wind bursts and some phases of rain. I woke up once because of the noise from the wind blowing against the tent. Put in my earphones and started to listen to the piano music :)</p>
<h2 id="morning">Morning</h2>
<p>We woke up at 8 am and were lucky as the rain stopped for a moment. We took the chance and packed up and started hiking. Soon after the rain started again.</p>

<p>As it was raining the whole morning, we pushed through the 8 km to the next hut.</p>

<p>We reached the next hut Alesjaurestugorna and of course it was out of shop hours :) Again we were allowed to buy some stuff anyhow.
Unfortunately we were not allowed to eat inside, so we had breakfast/lunch outside.</p>

<h2 id="afternoon">Afternoon</h2>
<p>There was a really nice beach spot on the way on, when the weather would have been better, we definitely would have taken a swim.</p>

<p>The weather stayed grey and there was rain from time to time. Even though it’s not the best hiking weather, it led to great views.</p>
<figure>

<p>Today it felt strange to being that close to the end. It was only 42 km left to Abisko, it was so close and then this easy lifestyle will be over once more.</p>
<p>The walk over the plateau continued, not too many views but was nice overall.</p>

            <p>View ahead</p>

</figure>

<p>Then the end of the large plateau came closer, we knew there would be a short but steep descent and then we would reach Abisko National Park.</p>
<figure>

         alt="Near the end of the plateau"/> <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>It didn’t took long and we reached the bottom of the valley. This was short before the NP started.</p>

<p>In Abisko National Park, camping is only allowed at 3 places. Abisko, 4 km before Abisko and at Abiskojaure (14 km before Abisko). Normally camping is allowed everywhere in Sweden, so this is a special rule here. We decided that nearly 10 km more to the 4 km before Abisko spot, was to much. In Abiskojaure we would have to pay as it‘s a hut as well. Therefore we decided to stay outside of the park and we found nice camping spots there.</p>

<p>So this was it, just one last night… felt so strange!</p>
