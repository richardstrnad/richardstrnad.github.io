<p>The night was cold, the close river probably didnâ€˜t helped with thatâ€¦ I had a really hard time to get out of the sleepingbag but as soon as the sunshine hit me, it was ok ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>As we reached the plateau yesterday before we set camp, the trail was mostly flat. There were a small climb and at the top we ate breakfast. I also needed to dry my shoes as there was some swampy area which gave wet feets.</p>

<h2 id="hard-day">Hard day</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s first say, we are really thankful for the great weather! So far only light rain and never for long.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong> the mosquitoes are a real pain today, even with spray they still stingâ€¦ and you can never rest and relax.</p>
<p>Therefore most of the day went by quickly, we didnâ€™t stop much but were still slowed down by swampy areas.</p>

</figure>

<p>The nature is still amazing, currently less mountains and more wide and open areas. A lot of water, which probably explains the mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Sometimes itâ€™s hard on the trail, but thatâ€™s part of it. And there is a saying â€žnever quit on a bad dayâ€œ</p>
<p>We found a nice spot for camping, but the mosquitoes there were crazy againâ€¦ so we built the tent up as fast as possible and relaxed a bit in the tent. We cooked a bit further down at the river and ate there, warm food was also food for the soul.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s it for today :)</p>
