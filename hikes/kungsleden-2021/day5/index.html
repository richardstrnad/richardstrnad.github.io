<p>Even if we love our tent and camping in the wild, a real bed is amazing after some days outside. The same goes for a shower and a breakfast. We had all of it in AmmarnÃ¤s, but  then it was time to hit the trail again.</p>
<p>During the night it rained lightly, but when we started around 10, it was still cloudy but dry.</p>

<p>The first stretch was quite steep and as the trail was going through forest, there were mosquitoes again. Therefore we powered all the way through to the top and did 10km and nearly 600m of elevation gain without a real break (2minute stop). We found a rock that protected us from the wind and had the first real stop there. The moment we sat down, light rain startedâ€¦ bad luck? ðŸ™ˆ</p>

<p>Thankfully the rain stopped shortly after we started to hike again. There were multiple lakes and we reached a newly built emergency hut in which we ate lunch.</p>

<h2 id="following-the-ridge">Following the ridge</h2>
<p>The path continued high up, a bit of wind but no mosquitoes. We reached the highest point of the stage (931m) which was marked with a stack of stones.</p>

<p>After that the trail started to slowly decline, soon we reached a lake and crossed another bridge over a small stream.
Then it was time to get back into the forest and with that, the mosquitoes were back ðŸ˜±</p>
<p>At the bottom of the valley we reached the RÃ¤vfallsstugan hut which is unmanned. But we met the cleaning crew there, which are the same guys that own the grocery store in AmmarnÃ¤s. We had a nice chat with them and I could even try dried Moose meat. Really delicious! ðŸ˜‹</p>
<p>We then decided to push on and make it out of the forest again. After a short but steep climb, we reached the next plateau. There we found a real nice spot to camp, right next to a river (and a bridge).</p>
