      <description>Overview KM: 0 by foot
Start: Rheinfelden
End: Hemavan
Train, Plane, Hotel and Plane again Getting to the start of the Kungsleden is quite a journey, at least when you live in switzerland or Rheinfelden to be more specific. There are various options, but we decided to go by plane in the end. As there are no direct (or even combined) flights available, we had to split the journey. So the first flight was Zurich -&amp;gt; Stockholm and as there was no flight which allowed us to capture the next flight to Hemavan on the same day, we went for a Hotel in Stockholm.</description>

      <description>Equipment for the Kungsleden For this year i wanted to put everything into a lighterpack and i really did it ðŸ¥³ This is mostly for myself and should help me in the future to optimize the weight.
Lighterpack Base weight could definitely be better and we are considering a ZPacks triplex for the future. But this is a topic for another day.
How does all this stuff look like? I captured two pictures of my equipment, one shows most of the stuff just loose.</description>

      <description>After we really enjoyed our nearly 3 week (20 days) hike on the via Alpina in 2020, we decided to go for another thruhike in 2021. There where multiple options in Switzerland which we considered but in the end we decided for Sweden and the Kungsleden.
Now 4 days before we leave for Stockholm, as first stop in our Journey, the final preparation is going on :)
More to follow soon&amp;hellip;</description>
